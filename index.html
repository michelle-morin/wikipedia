            <p>Ham Wall is an English wetland and National Nature Reserve located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) west of
              Glastonbury on the Somerset Levels. It is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which
              helps coordinate conservation issues across the Somerset Levels as part of the Avalon Marshes Partnership.
              The reserve was constructed originally to provide reed bed habitat for the bittern, which in 1997 was at a
              low population level in the UK. The site is divided into sections with independently controllable water
              levels, and machinery and cattle are used to maintain the quality of the reed beds. The reserve hosts
              important breeding populations of the rare little bittern and great white egret, and has other uncommon
              animals and plants. Potential future threats may include heavy summer rains and extensive flooding. Sea
              level rise may make drainage more difficult, and current water pumping facilities may become inadequate.

          <p class="vertical"> Caleb Strong (January 9, 1745 – November 7, 1819) was an American lawyer and politician who twice served
            as Governor of Massachusetts, once from 1800 to 1807, and again from 1812 until 1816. He assisted in
            drafting the Constitution of Massachusetts in 1779, and served in the Massachusetts Senate and on the
            Massachusetts Governor's Council, before being elected to the inaugural United States Senate in 1789. The
            War of 1812 influenced Strong to come out of retirement and run again for governor. It was largely his
            policies during the war that aroused secessionist sentiment in Maine, when Massachusetts's pro-British
            merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders.</p>
